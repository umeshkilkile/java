PriorityQueue
	- A priority queue says that the element that goes next is the one with the greatest need (the highest priority).
	- For example, in an airport, a customer might be pulled out of a queue if their plane is about to leave. If you build a messaging system, some messages will be more important than others, and should be dealt with sooner, regardless of when they arrive.
	- When you offer( ) an object onto a PriorityQueue, that object is sorted into the queue.
	- The default sorting uses the natural order of the objects in the queue, but you can modify the order by providing your own Comparator. The PriorityQueue ensures that when you call peek( ), poll( ) or remove( ), the element you get will be the one with the highest priority.
