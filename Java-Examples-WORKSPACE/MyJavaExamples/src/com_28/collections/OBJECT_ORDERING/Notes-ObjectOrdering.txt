Object Ordering
	- If the List consists of String elements, it will be sorted into alphabetical order. 
	- If it consists of Date elements, it will be sorted into chronological order. How does this happen? String and Date both implement 
		the Comparable interface.
	- Comparable implementations provide a natural ordering for a class, which allows objects of that class to be sorted automatically.
	- If you try to sort a list, the elements of which do not implement Comparable, Collections.sort(list) will throw a ClassCastException. 
	- Similarly, Collections.sort(list, comparator) will throw a ClassCastException if you try to sort a list whose elements cannot be compared to one another using the comparator.
