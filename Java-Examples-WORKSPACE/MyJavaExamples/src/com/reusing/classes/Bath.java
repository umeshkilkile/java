/*
 * If you want the references initialized, you can do it:
 * 
 * 1. At the point the objects are defined. This means that they’ll always be
 * initialized before the constructor is called.
 * 
 * 2. In the constructor for that class.
 * 
 * 3. Right before you actually need to use the object. This is often called
 * lazy initialization. It can reduce overhead in situations where object
 * creation is expensive and the object doesn’t need to be created every time.
 * 
 * 4. Using instance initialization.
