- Almost all operators work only with primitives. The exceptions are ‘=‘, ‘==‘ and ‘!=‘, which work with all objects (and are a point of confusion for objects). In addition, the String class supports ‘+’ and ‘+=‘.
- System.out.println( ) statement involves the ‘+’ operator. In this context, ‘+’ means “string concatenation” and, if necessary, “string conversion.” When the compiler sees a String followed by a ‘+’ followed by a non-String, it attempts to convert the non-String into a String. As you can see from the output, it successfully converts from int into String for a and b.
