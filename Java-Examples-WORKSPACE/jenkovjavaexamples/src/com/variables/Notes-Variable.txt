In Java there are four types of variables:

	1. Non-static fields
		- A non-static field is a variable that belongs to an object. 
		- Objects keep their internal state in non-static fields. 
		- Non-static fields are also called instance variables, because they belong to instances (objects) of a class
	2. Static fields
		- A static field is a variable that belongs to a class. 
		- A static field has the same value for all objects that access it. 
		- Static fields are also called class variables.
	3. Local variables
		- A local variable is a variable declared inside a method. 
		- A local variable is only accessible inside the method that declared it.
	4. Parameters
		- A parameter is a variable that is passed to a method when the method is called. 
		- Parameters are also only accessible inside the method that declares them, although a value is assigned to them when the method is called.
