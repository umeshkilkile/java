Nested Classes
	- In Java nested classes are classes that are defined inside another class.
	- The purpose of a nested class is to clearly group the nested class with its surrounding class, signaling that these two classes 
		are to be used together. Or perhaps that the nested class is only to be used from inside its enclosing (owning) class.
	- Java developers often refer to nested classes as inner classes, but inner classes (non-static nested classes) are only one out of several different types of nested classes in Java.
	- In Java nested classes are considered members of their enclosing class. Thus, a nested class can be declared public, package (no access modifier), protected and private
	- You can create several different types of nested classes in Java. The different Java nested class types are:

		- Static nested classes
		- Non-static nested classes
		- Local classes
		- Anonymous classes
