Strings
	- The Java String data type can contain a sequence (string) of characters, like pearls on a string.
	- A Java String (before Java 9) is represented internally in the Java VM using bytes, encoded as UTF-16. 
		UTF-16 uses 2 bytes to represent a single character. 
		Thus, the characters of a Java String are represented using a char array.
	- UTF is a character encoding that can represent characters from a lot of different languages (alphabets). 
		That is why it is necessary to use 2 bytes per character - to be able to represent all these different characters within a single string.
	- Strings in Java are objects. Therefore you need to use the new operator to create a new Java String object.
	- More precisely, objects representing Java String literals are obtained from a constant String pool which the Java virtual machine 
		keeps internally. That means, that even classes from different projects compiled separately, but which are used in the same 
		application may share constant String objects. The sharing happens at runtime. It is not a compile time feature.
