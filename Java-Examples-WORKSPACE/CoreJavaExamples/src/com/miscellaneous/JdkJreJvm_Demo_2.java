/*
 * Differences between JDK, JRE and JVM
 * 
 * JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT
 * 
 * - The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used
 * for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime
 * Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an
 * archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in
 * Java development.
 * 
 * JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
 * 
 * - JRE stands for “Java Runtime Environment” and may also be written as “Java
 * RTE.” The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for
 * executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
 * core classes, and supporting files.
 * 
 * JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE
 * 
 * It is:
 * 
 * - A specification where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But
 * implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its
 * implementation has been provided by Sun and other companies.
 * 
 * - An implementation is a computer program that meets the requirements of the
 * JVM specification
 * 
 * - Runtime Instance Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to
 * run the java class, an instance of JVM is created.
 * 
 * Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM
 * 
 * JRE = JVM + Library classes
 * 
 * JDK = JRE + Development tools
 * 
 * JDK – Java Development Kit (in short JDK) is Kit which provides the
 * environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program. JDK is a kit(or
 * package) which includes two things
 * 
 * - Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
 * 
 * - JRE (to execute your java program).
 * 
 * Note : JDK is only used by Java Developers.
 * 
 * JRE – Java Runtime Environment (to say JRE) is an installation package which
 * provides environment to only run(not develop) the java program(or
 * application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by them who only wants to run
 * the Java Programs i.e. end users of your system.
 * 
 * JVM – Java Virtual machine(JVM) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE
 * because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run
 * using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java
 * program line by line hence it is also known as interpreter.
 * 
 * How does JRE and JDK works?
 * 
 * What does JRE consists of?
 * 
 * - JRE consists of the following components:
 * 
 * - Deployment technologies, including deployment, Java Web Start and Java
 * Plug-in.
 * 
 * - User interface toolkits, including Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Swing,
 * Java 2D, Accessibility, Image I/O, Print Service, Sound, drag and drop (DnD)
 * and input methods.
 * 
 * - Integration libraries, including Interface Definition Language (IDL), Java
 * Database Connectivity (JDBC), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI),
 * Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Remote Method Invocation Over Internet
 * Inter-Orb Protocol (RMI-IIOP) and scripting.
 * 
 * - Other base libraries, including international support, input/output (I/O),
 * extension mechanism, Beans, Java Management Extensions (JMX), Java Native
 * Interface (JNI), Math, Networking, Override Mechanism, Security,
 * Serialization and Java for XML Processing (XML JAXP).
 * 
 * - Lang and util base libraries, including lang and util, management,
 * versioning, zip, instrument, reflection, Collections, Concurrency Utilities,
 * Java Archive (JAR), Logging, Preferences API, Ref Objects and Regular
 * Expressions.
 * 
 * - Java Virtual Machine (JVM), including Java HotSpot Client and Server
 * Virtual Machines.
 * 
 * How does JRE works?
 * 
 * - To understand how the JRE works let us consider a Java source file saved as
 * Example.java. The file is compiled into a set of Byte Code that is stored in
 * a “.class” file.
 * 
 * The following actions occur at runtime.
 * 
 * - Class Loader The Class Loader loads all necessary classes needed for the
 * execution of a program. It provides security by separating the namespaces of
 * the local file system from that imported through the network. These files are
 * loaded either from a hard disk, a network or from other sources.
 * 
 * - Byte Code Verifier The JVM puts the code through the Byte Code Verifier
 * that checks the format and checks for an illegal code. Illegal code, for
 * example, is code that violates access rights on objects or violates the
 * implementation of pointers.
 * 
 * The Byte Code verifier ensures that the code adheres to the JVM specification
 * and does not violate system integrity.
 * 
 * Intrepreter
 * 
 * - At runtime the Byte Code is loaded, checked and run by the interpreter. The
 * interpreter has the following two functions:
 * 
 * - Execute the Byte Code
 * 
 * - Make appropriate calls to the underlying hardware
 * 
 * How does JVM works?
 * 
 * - JVM becomes an instance of JRE at runtime of a Java program. It is widely
 * known as a runtime interpreter.JVM largely helps in the abstraction of inner
 * implementation from the programmers who make use of libraries for their
 * programmes from JDK.
