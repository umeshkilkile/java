/*
 * - A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only
 * contain method signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an
 * implementation of the methods, only the signature (name, parameters and
 * exceptions) of the method.
 * 
 * - You can use interfaces in Java as a way to achieve polymorphism.
 * 
 * - A Java interface can be declared public or package scope (no access
 * modifier).
