/*
 * Note that the fields of a final class can be final or not, as you choose. The
 * same rules apply to final for fields regardless of whether the class is
 * defined as final. However, because it prevents inheritance, all methods in a
 * final class are implicitly final, since there’s no way to override them. You
 * can add the final specifier to a method in a final class, but it doesn’t add
 * any meaning.
