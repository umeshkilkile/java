/*
 * 
 * - Each of the classes Candy, Gum, and Cookie has a static clause that is
 * executed as the class is loaded for the first time. Information will be
 * printed to tell you when loading occurs for that class. In main( ), the
 * object creations are spread out between print statements to help detect the
 * time of loading.
 * 
 * - You can see from the output that each Class object is loaded only when it’s
 * needed, and the static initialization is performed upon class loading.
