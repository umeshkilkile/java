/*
 * Cake is able to create a Pie object and call its f( ) method. You’d typically
 * think that Pie and f( ) have package access and are therefore not available
 * to Cake. They do have package access—that part is correct. The reason that
 * they are available in Cake.java is because they are in the same directory and
 * have no explicit package name. Java treats files like this as implicitly part
 * of the “default package” for that directory, and thus they provide package
 * access to all the other files in that directory.
