	/**
	 * 
	 * More generally, method declarations have six components, in order:

    1. Modifiers—such as public, private, and others.
    2. The return type—the data type of the value returned by the method, or void if the method does not return a value.
    3. The method name—the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.
    4. The parameter list in parenthesis—a comma-delimited list of input parameters, preceded by their data types, enclosed by parentheses, (). 
       If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses.
    5. An exception list.
    6. The method body, enclosed between braces—the method's code, including the declaration of local variables, goes here.
